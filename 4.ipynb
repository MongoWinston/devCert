    "# Welcome to Session 4: Driver Considerations and Data Modelling\n",
    "As the title says, welcome to session 4. This session will be slightly different from the previous 3 sessions.\n",
    "The first session was a conceptual overview of MongoDB and \"getting started\"\n",
    "Sessions 2 and 3 were content heavy and introduced many of specifics of working with MongoDB as a developer.\n",
    "This session is intended on taking sessions 1-3 and applying the concepts as it relates to actually _developing applications against MongoDB_ \n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, we will be taking many of the concepts from (2) and (3) which were primarily in the mongo shell, and showing those concepts using a MongoDB driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**THIS SESSION USES THE PYMONGO DRIVER WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL MONGODB PYTHON DRIVER. DRIVERS DIFFER IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION FROM LANGAGUE TO LANGUAGE.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drivers\n",
    "A _driver_ is a program (or SDK) that implements a protocol for a database connection. More practically what that means is, its the functiona that allows a developer to connect to a database, read and write data, etc... USE THE DATABASE!\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB maintains and supports drivers in many different languages. However the certification is only offered in Python, NodeJS, Java, and C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some basic python use of the MongoDB driver:"

    "\n",
    "Regardless of the language used, the format of the connection string will be similar. An example is above ^\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following components:\n",
    "- `mongodb+srv` implies that the protocol for communication between the app and the database is the mongodb+srv protocol. That uses DNS lookups to route to the proper MongoDB node.\n",
    "- `<username>:<password>@` is used for auth\n",
    "- `devcert.6ngvd.mongodb.net` is the resource identifier for the hosts\n",
    "- `?retryWrites=true&w=majority` are options for the connection. in this case, retryable writes are turned on and write concern is majority.\n",
    "- `&tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true` is another option that **was only added becuase these Jupyter Notebooks are pinned to Python2.8.19 which does not have a valid certificate to authenticate against MongoDB. Don't do it in real life**\n",
    "\n",
    "the `mongodb+srv` protocol is relatively new and becoming more common, but for educational purposes, let's look at a \"traditional\" connection string\n",
    "\n",
    "`mongodb://<username>:<password>@devcert-shard-00-00.6ngvd.mongodb.net:27017,devcert-shard-00-01.6ngvd.mongodb.net:27017,devcert-shard-00-02.6ngvd.mongodb.net:27017/?ssl=true&replicaSet=atlas-vnu7kz-shard-0&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority`\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- each host and port are exposed when not using the +srv protocol\n",
    "- more options are required, notably `ssl=true` and `replicaSet=atlas-vnu7kz-shard-0` Both of these options are hidden behind the `+srv` connection string\n",
    "\n",
    "## Driver Behavior in Contrast to the Shell\n",
    "Using the shell, a single user expects an interactive experience\n",
    "An application that uses MongoDB via the driver has much different access patterns:\n",
    "- oftentimes there are more than 1 user trying to use the application\n",
    "- interactions with the database are ephemeral\n",
    "\n",

    "## Notes and Reflections from the Above Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 1:** This shows how Python deals with data typing in MongoDB.\n",
    "- `datetime` is a standard Python module, and the Pymongo driver uses Python datetimes that cast to ISODates on the database (remember BSON types from session 1?)\n",
    "- `bson` is a package that is installed when installing the Pymongo driver. In this case, I use it later to query a document based on an `ObjectId` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 2:** This block shows how a _document_ is created in Python. Note that a python dictionary is essentially saved as a document. Generally, for all languages, the standard \"object\" is what is stored to MongoDB. Javascript objects, POJOs, Python dicts, Go structs, etc are examples of \"objects\" that are stored to the server. **This is a core feature of the database** Also notice that `True` has a captital T. In javascript, it is `true`. These are the language specific changes that might come up. Another Python / Javascript difference is that the developer has to encase the key with quotations, where in JS that is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 3:** This is a standard `delete_many` with no filter to reset the demo. Note that python is `based_on_underscores` not `camelCase` like the shell and Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 4:** A few things to note here. First of all, this is a fairly typical pattern that we see for inserts. The pattern I am describing is declaring a variable as the output of a insert/update/delete. This has the side effect of performing that action against the database, and the variable becomes a `result object` that represents metadata about the write operation (if it is successful, Ids of documents inserted, etc). Also I want to comment on timing. Python is a synchronous language, which means the assignment of the variable `insertResult` _waits_ for the call to the database to be complete. **Javascript is asynchronous. So if we ran a similar function in JS, the variable `insertResult` would be a Javascript `promise`. The developer needs to use callbacks, async/await, etc to deal with this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 5:** Basically the point here is that a string doesn't match an ObjectID. The first update doesn't actually match on anything due to that point. So I use the `bson` library implementation of the `ObjectId` to filter on ObjectId. Then there is an update statement which is essentially the same as any update statement in the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment 6:** Is all about _cursor iteration_. This shows 2 ways that python can access documents from a cursor (remember `find()` returns a `cursor`, not documents). \n",
    "1. `for <document> in <cursor>` allows the application to iterate through a cursor, performing actions on each document returned\n",
    "2. `list(<cursor>)` in another (less common) way to exhaust a cursor. It tells the application to take the result set and create a list (array) out of that result set. **This can be a heavy operation to the app for a large read**\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, each language has its own ways for iterating over a cursor. Knowing them is important for the test.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Data Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know how to use the MongoDB language, and drivers, etc to perform operations against the database. As a \"real\" developer, this is just the beginning. **The point of learning MongoDB is to use it to create solutions**. To that end, a developer often has to choose how they relate the problem they are trying to solve to a data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned about how flexible MongoDB is, as it relates to data modelling. In the relational world, the heuristic that developers use is the **3rd normal form**. With MongoDB, there are so many ways to model data and thus there is no \"rule\" like 3rd normalization. Instead, there are guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data that is accessed together should be stored together\n",
    "- The \"N\" of 1:N and N:N relations _matters_\n",
    "- Consider the fields that are used to filter and fields that are often modified\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding versus Linking**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous sessions, we were also exposed to the aggregation framework `$lookup` stage, and many were surprised to find out that MongoDB _does_ have the ability to perform operations like `SQL JOINs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a fundamental question when designing a data model is to **embed**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// people collection\n",
    "{\n",
    "    _id:1,\n",
    "    name:\"Winston\",\n",
    "    cars:[{year:2023,model:\"Tesla Model Y\"},{year:1963,model:\"Pontiac Firebird\"}]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or **link**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// people collection\n",
    "{\n",
    "    _id:1,\n",
    "    name:\"Winston\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "// cars collection\n",
    "{\n",
    "    _id:2,\n",
    "    year:2023,\n",
    "    model:\"Tesla Model Y\",\n",
    "    ownerID:1\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "    _id:3,\n",
    "    year:1963,\n",
    "    model:\"Pontiac Firebird\",\n",
    "    ownerID:1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **embedding** paradigm, 1:N relationsihips are modelled via arrays within a document. When **linking**, 1:N relationships are modelled via a foreign key relationship in a seperate collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Neither of these paradigms are wrong._ It depends on the nature of the use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding** would support highly efficient computing for the following types of use cases:\n",
    "- Using `name` as a filter, and returning the associated `cars`\n",
    "- Situations in which people rarely have a lot of cars (unbounded arrays are bad)\n",
    "- Generally this has high performance reads, potentially at the expense of writes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linking** would support the following types of use cases:\n",
    "- Frequent updates on `car` data (for instance, if there was a field \"milage\" which is often updated)\n",
    "- Queries based on car parameters in which the owner of the car is the desired output\n",
    "- Generally this has balanced read/write performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sample_mflix` sample dataset has an example of how a developer might reason about embedding versus linking. The `cast` and `genres` fields are embedded inside documents inside the `movies` collection. There is also a seperate collection for `comments`. This makes sense because a movie will rarely have more than 10 actors or associated genres. However, there could be a effectively limitless amount of comments, and these comments might be frequently edited. "
